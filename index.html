The courses are organized in the four main fields: Aerodynamics of Aerospace Vehicles; Flight Dynamics, orbital mechanics and Controls; Aerospace structural analysis; Gas turbine and Rocket propulsion. A capstone project leading to design of aircraft and space vehicles using all the tools developed familiarizes the students with the application of these courses to synthesize an entire system/ vehicle. There are 3 levels of courses in the program: foundation, diploma and the degree. After diploma, a few students selected based on their performance in a test and an interview conducted by IIT Madras will get an opportunity to attend the remaining classes in person on-campus. Rest of the students who meet the criteria fixed by IITM can continue in a hybrid mode towards acquiring the degree.</p>

                    IIT Madras has always strived to provide high-quality education accessible to the widest possible denomination.
                    Today, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Space Technology are major sunrise sectors in India, in civilian as well as
                    defence domains. India is aspiring to be a net defence exporter and a large fraction of related technologies are in
                    the fields of Aeronautics and Space Technology. A number of private industries and Defence Public Sector
                    Undertakings (DPSUs) have come up recently. They require engineers with an understanding of the corresponding design
                    & analysis tools and their utility/ limitations, which would help them to develop state-of-the-art/ future
                    technologies & products. As the demand is much more than supply for well trained good quality Engineers in these
                    sectors, Government of India is promoting education and training programmes. IIT Madras is one of the 5 regional
                    centers identified and funded by MEITy to promote UAV related technology and has also engaged with ISRO right from
                    its inception. To support the efforts towards capacity building in these sectors, IIT Madras is introducing this BS
                    programme in Aeronautics and Space Technology, which is also aligned with the goals of the National Educational
                    Policy. We hope that it meets the aspirations of the students as well as the Industries of this great nation.
